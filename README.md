    <img src="/shots/mobile/login_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

2. After you are logged in, you will be redirected to the homepage. As you can see on the screenshot below, there are 50 trending songs that are provided and there is a navigation bar at the top and sidebar on the left. We can go to our profile by clicking the profile section at the top right.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/shots/desktop/home_1_desktop.png" style="width: 100%; flex: 2;">
    <img src="/shots/mobile/home_1_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

We can search for other songs based on the keyword in the input we have filled in. This only limited to 50 related songs.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/shots/desktop/home_2_desktop.png" style="width: 100%; flex: 2;">
    <img src="/shots/mobile/home_2_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

3. Navigate yourself by the sidebar on the left. You can make use of the burger menu at the left side of the navigation bar to open the sidebar. Each menu will lead you to each feature, except for the logout, it will redirect you to the login page and you won't be able to go to the homepage anymore unless you create a new token by redoing the login.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/shots/desktop/sidebar_desktop.png" style="width: 100%; flex: 2;">
    <img src="/shots/mobile/sidebar_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

4. After we click the 'My Playlist' menu on the sidebar, we will be redirected to a new page, which provides you a list of the playlists that you have.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/shots/desktop/my-playlist_1_desktop.png" style="width: 100%; flex: 2;">
    <img src="/shots/mobile/my-playlist_1_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

5. To go to the detail of each playlist, click on the card that you want and you will see this screen. The screen provides you the information of the playlist such as name, title, and the songs that are in the playlist.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/shots/desktop/playlist-detail_1_desktop.png" style="width: 100%; flex: 2;">
    <img src="/shots/mobile/playlist-detail_1_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

6. Now we're heading to the 'Create Playlist' page! Now we will try to make a new playlist to your Spotify connected (yes it is connected!ðŸ˜‰).

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/shots/desktop/create-playlist_1_desktop.png" style="width: 100%; flex: 2;">
    <img src="/shots/mobile/create-playlist_1_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

Oops, you need to make the name to be 10 characters longðŸ˜œ

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/shots/desktop/create-playlist_2_desktop.png" style="width: 100%; flex: 2;">
    <img src="/shots/mobile/create-playlist_2_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

So should the description, it should be 20 characters long.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/shots/desktop/create-playlist_3_desktop.png" style="width: 100%; flex: 2;">
    <img src="/shots/mobile/create-playlist_3_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

 Look at the 'Create' button, it has changed to the green color which means 'You're good to go!'. Now you can click on the button as all of the data have been validated.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/shots/desktop/create-playlist_4_desktop.png" style="width: 100%; flex: 2;">
    <img src="/shots/mobile/create-playlist_4_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

Yeay you've made it!!

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/shots/desktop/create-playlist_5_desktop.png" style="width: 100%; flex: 2;">
    <img src="/shots/mobile/create-playlist_5_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

7. Then you will be redirected to the 'My Playlist' page to show you that your playlist have been successfully made.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/shots/desktop/my-playlist_2_desktop.png" style="width: 100%; flex: 2;">
    <img src="/shots/mobile/my-playlist_2_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

You also can go to the detail page to see the description of your playlist and look, there is still no track in the playlist. Now, it's time for us to add a new track to the playlist.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/shots/desktop/detail-playlist_2_desktop.png" style="width: 100%; flex: 2;">
    <img src="/shots/mobile/detail-playlist_2_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

8. How do we do that? Go to the homepage first, hover on the track card that you want to add (for desktop) or click on that track card (for mobile) until you see a play button.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/shots/desktop/home_3_desktop.png" style="width: 100%; flex: 2;">
    <img src="/shots/mobile/home_3_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

Then, click on the play button and you will see a modal pop out on the screen.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/shots/desktop/home_4_desktop.png" style="width: 100%; flex: 2;">
    <img src="/shots/mobile/home_4_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

Select the playlist that you want the track to be added into and click on the 'Add' button.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/shots/desktop/home_5_desktop.png" style="width: 100%; flex: 2;">
    <img src="/shots/mobile/home_5_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

When you see this modal, it means that the track has been successfully added to the playlist that you just chose.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/shots/desktop/home_7_desktop.png" style="width: 100%; flex: 2;">
    <img src="/shots/mobile/home_7_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

9. Go to the 'My Playlist' check to see if you have added the track.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/shots/desktop/my-playlist_3_desktop.png" style="width: 100%; flex: 2;">
    <img src="/shots/mobile/my-playlist_3_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

10. When you check the detail of the playlist, you can also see that the track has been added.

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <img src="/shots/desktop/playlist-detail_3_desktop.png" style="width: 100%; flex: 2;">
    <img src="/shots/mobile/playlist-detail_3_mobile.jpg" style="flex: 1;"> 
</div>

11. Now that you have finished all of the tutorials, you may logout by clicking the 'Logout' menu on the sidebar.
